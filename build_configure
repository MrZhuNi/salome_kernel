# ====================================================================
# This script is just here to illustrate the procedure for preparing
# the configure process. It creates configuration files (ex:
# ltmain.sh) using libtoolize, the aclocal macro, the configure script
# using autoconf and some scripts used in building process (ex:
# install-sh) using automake. Note that automake is not used here to
# creates the files Makefile.in from the files Makefile.am (a next
# step probably).

# This creates the aclocal.m4 file from the standard macro and the
# custom macro embedded in the directory salome_adm/unix/config_files.
aclocal -I salome_adm/unix/config_files

# This creates the configure script from the file configure.ac (or
# configure.in if configure.ac doesn't exist)
autoconf

# This instruction creates some configuration files (ltmain.sh,
# config.guess and config.sub). It only depends on the libtool
# version. The files are created in the directory specified with the
# AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(<mydir>) tag (see configure.ac).
#libtoolize --force

# This instruction creates some scripts used in building process
# (install-sh, missing, ...). It only depends on the automake
# version. The files are created in the directory specified with the
# AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(<mydir>) tag (see configure.ac).
#automake -a -c
