\page kernelpypkg_page Programming Interface of the KERNEL python package

Sorry, but the documentation is not available yet in doxygen format.

Fortunately, a documentation exists in restructured format and then
can be generated here using sphinx, in the expectative of the doxygen
version.

Please refer to this <a href="../../tui/KERNEL/docutils/index.html">
documentation of the KERNEL python packages</a>.
